## Overview
This Shiny application implements a physicsâ€‘based workflow to estimate volumetric soil moisture from microwave brightness temperature (BT):

1. **Tauâ€‘Omega Radiative Transfer Model**  
   Simulate the microwave brightness temperature of the soilâ€“vegetation system under a userâ€‘selected incidence angle.

2. **Permittivity Inversion**  
   Invert the simulated brightness temperature to retrieve the complex soil dielectric permittivity (Îµ) via the Tauâ€‘Omega inverse formulation.

3. **Mironov etÂ al. Dielectric Mixing Equation**  
   Apply Mironov etÂ al.Â (2004) to compute volumetric water content W:
   \[
     W = \frac{n_d - \sqrt{\varepsilon} + \omega_t\,(\,n_b - n_u\,)}{1 - n_u}
   \]
   where  
   - \(n_d=1.506\), \(n_b=6.591\), \(n_u=10.428\) are empirical refractive indices,  
   - \(\omega_t\) is the volumetric water fraction input,  
   - \(\varepsilon\) is the inverted permittivity.  

## Usage
1. **Upload** your permittivity dataset (`.xlsx`).  
2. **Select** incidence angle (30Â°,Â 40Â°,Â 50Â°).  
3. **Choose** observed vs. predicted channels.  
4. **Explore** scatter plots (with RMSE, bias, RÂ², ubRMSE) and timeâ€‘series diagnostics.
